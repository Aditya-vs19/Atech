# 🚀 Atech – SOM Project  

Atech is a concept project where I used a **3D model** 🌀 to design a website that represents the idea of an **email delivery platform** 📧.  
The goal of this project was to combine **visual creativity** 🎨 with a **practical tech concept** 💻, making it more engaging and easy to understand.  

## ✨ Features  
- 🎭 3D model integration for modern design  
- 📡 Concept showcase of an email delivery platform  
- 🧾 Clean and minimal UI  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- 🌐 **HTML**  
- 🎨 **CSS**  
- ⚡ **JavaScript**  
- 🌀 3D model integration (using Three.js / relevant libraries)  

## 🎯 Project Purpose  
This project was built as part of my **SOM (Self-Organizing Map) learning journey** 🧩 to explore how **design** and **technical ideas** can blend together.
